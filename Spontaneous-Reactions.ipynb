It is then clear that, in large systems, spontaneous reactions cannot decrease the entropy of the world, $0\\leq\\Delta S_{\\text{tot}},$ which is one formulation fo the second law. \n",

Assuming that the generalized coordinates of the reservoir don't change, we can Taylor expand the reservoir entropy change $\\Delta S_R=\\Delta E_R/T_R$ in terms of the energy change $\\Delta E_R$ of the reservoir (just as we did to derive the Boltzmann factor). In terms of the the *heat* $Q\\equiv-\\Delta E_R$ added to the system, we thus have\n",

    "Also a footnote about $U$: In the context of spontaneous processes, we define it as an ensemble average of the energy of the system. That ensemble average can have a time dependence if the system starts out of equilibrium and is allowed to relax. Example: Consider a bottle of initially cold water that we through into a hot tub. The temperature of the bottle will increase over time until the temperature of the bottle matches the temperature of the hot tub. The energy $E_S(t)$  of the bottle will generally increase towards the peak energy (from above), but the time series will show fluctuations: If we repeat the entire experiment, $E_S(t)$ will look slightly different because  the fluctuations are different. But the ensemble average $U(t)$ over (infinitely) many realizations of the non-equilibrium process will be a deterministic time-dependent function."
