Even though there is some interaction on the interface between the small cubes, the interaction energies are negligible compared to the relevant bulk energies.

    "Suppose we end up measuring the micro-state of our system of $N$ coin flips or dice tosses, how many bits do we need to store this information?\n",

This needs $\\log_{2}\\left(e^{S}\\right)=S \\cdot \\log_{2}(e)$ bits. (of course, this is not a proof, but it works because of CLT-induced measure concentration.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shannon thus gave an operational meaning to $S$ in terms of \"information\" and the resources required to communicate an ensemble of messages, where each message represents a sequence of dice throws. Each symbol of the message represents a discrete random variable $X$, attaining a value $x_i$ with probability $p_i$.

    "1. Generate $ X $ from a standard normal distribution.\n",

    "To see how the ideas of entropy reduction and information work in a real example,  let’s consider the response of a neuron to sensory inputs (for more, see Bialek's book, Ch. 6.2 {cite}`bialek2012biophysics` and the original paper published in PRL{cite}`strong1998entropy`). \n",
    "Figure 6.5 shows the results of experiments on the motion-sensitive neuron H1 in the fly visual system. In these experiments, a fly sees a randomly moving pattern,  and H1 responds with a stream of spikes. If we fix $\\Delta \\tau = 3$ms nd look at $T = 30$ ms  segments of the spike train, there are $2T /\\Delta \\tau \\sim 10^3$ possible words, but the distribution is biased, and the entropy is only $S(T, \\Delta \\tau)\\sim$ 5 bits$ <\\log_2(10^3)\\sim 10$ bits. This relatively low entropy  means that we can still sample the distributions of words even out to $T \\sim 50−60$ ms,  which is interesting, because the fly can actually generate a flight correction in response  to visual motion inputs within $\\sim 30$ ms. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As the time resolution $\\Delta \\tau$ is varied from 800 ms down to 2 ms,  the information rate follows the entropy rate $S(\\text{Words})$, with a nearly constant 50% efficiency.  This result was influential because it suggests that neurons are making use of a significant fraction of their capacity in actually encoding sensory signals. Also, this is true even at millisecond time resolution. The  idea that the entropy of the spike train sets a limit to neural information transmission  emerged almost immediately after Shannon’s work, but it was never clear whether these limits could be approached by real systems. \n"
