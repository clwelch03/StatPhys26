    "\n",
    "Shannon thus gave an operational meaning to $S$ in terms of \"information\" and the resources required to communicate an ensemble of messages, where each message represents a sequence of dice throws. Each symbol of the message represents a discrete random variable $X$, attaining a value $x_i$ with probability $p_i$.

    "Figure 6.5 shows the results of experiments on the motion-sensitive neuron H1 in the fly visual system. In these experiments, a fly sees a randomly moving pattern,  and H1 responds with a stream of spikes. If we fix $\\Delta \\tau = 3$ms nd look at $T = 30$ ms  segments of the spike train, there are $2T /\\Delta \\tau \\sim 10^3$ possible words, but the distribution is biased, and the entropy is only $S(T, \\Delta \\tau)\\sim$ 5 bits$ <\\log_2(10^3)\\sim 10$ bits. This relatively low entropy  means that we can still sample the distributions of words even out to $T \\sim 50−60$ ms,  which is interesting, because the fly can actually generate a flight correction in response  to visual motion inputs within $\\sim 30$ ms.

    "As the time resolution $\\Delta \\tau$ is varied from 800 ms down to 2 ms,  the information rate follows the entropy rate $S(\\text{Words})$, with a nearly constant 50% efficiency.  This result was influential because it suggests that neurons are making use of a significant fraction of their capacity in actually encoding sensory signals. Also, this is true even at millisecond time resolution. The  idea that the entropy of the spike train sets a limit to neural information transmission  emerged almost immediately after Shannon’s work, but it was never clear whether these limits could be approached by real systems. \n"
