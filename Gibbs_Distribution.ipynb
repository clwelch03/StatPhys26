    "We have seen how the exchange of energy between reservoir and system biases the microstates of the system in a way described by a Boltzmann factor. In this section, we'll see that the same happens when we trade other conserved quantities, like particle numbers or volume, except that the corresponding Boltzmann factors involved other (conjugated) variables than energy and temperature. We will also find that mathematically the same happens under the action of an external force, generating a Boltzmann factor that involves the force and the conjugated extensive quantity of the system, e.g. an external pressure acting on the volume of the system or a magnetic field acting on the magnetization of the system.
